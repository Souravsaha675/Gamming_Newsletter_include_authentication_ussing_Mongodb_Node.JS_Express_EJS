          It’s a fact that playing video games is one of the most popular forms of entertainment today for both kids and adults worldwide. Statistics can prove it.

In 2013, for example, Nielsen revealed that gamers in the U.S. aged 13 and older spent 6.3 hours every week playing video games. This figure was up from 5.6 hours in 2012. Among the systems most frequently used, the personal computer was beaten by Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. Mobile phones were on third place followed by tablets.
